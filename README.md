SVM and Quantum Powered AI Fraud Detection in Banking

Abstract: 

This project proposes a cutting-edge fraud detection system for the banking sector, leveraging Hybrid Support Vector Machines (SVM), Quantum Computing, Adaptive AI Learning, and Blockchain Security.
Our approach dynamically adapts to evolving fraud patterns, ensuring real-time fraud prevention while preserving user privacy through Zero-Knowledge Proofs and federated learning.

Problem Statement:

Traditional banking fraud detection systems suffer from:
Slow response to emerging fraud techniques
High false positives impacting customer experience
Poor scalability under large transaction volumes
Data privacy vulnerabilities in cross-institutional collaborations

Objectives:

Enhance Accuracy: Use Hybrid SVM models and Adaptive AI to improve fraud detection.
Real-Time Prevention: Accelerate fraud detection with Quantum-SVM techniques.
Preserve Privacy: Apply Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Federated Learning.
Improve Scalability: Integrate Big Data analytics and distributed processing.

Novelty of the Invention:

Real-Time Adaptive Learning: Dynamic model updating using reinforcement learning.
Hybrid SVM Model: Combining One-Class SVM (OC-SVM) and Multi-Class SVM (MC-SVM) to lower false positives.
Quantum Computing Acceleration: Quantum-SVM for ultra-fast fraud detection.
Blockchain Ledger Security: Tamper-proof record-keeping using Hyperledger Fabric.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP): Fraud verification without sensitive data exposure.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: 
Gathered real-world banking transaction datasets.
Feature engineering: transaction velocity, user behavioral biometrics, geolocation variance.
Standardization and normalization for model training.

2. Hybrid SVM Model: 
OC-SVM: Anomaly detection.
MC-SVM: Fraud classification.
Hyperparameter tuning using Auto-Sklearn for dynamic adaptability.

4. Quantum-SVM Integration: 
Implemented Quantum-SVM using quantum computing libraries (e.g., Qiskit).
Achieved significant speed-up in fraud detection.

5. Adaptive Learning: 
Reinforcement learning for continuous model refinement.
Federated learning across institutions to preserve user data privacy.

6. Blockchain and Data Security: 
Hyperledger Fabric for fraud case recording.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs for secure and private transaction validation.

7. Risk Scoring: 
Developed AI-powered multi-layered risk scoring based on user behavior, location, and transaction patterns.
